## Dev Set Up

1. Install:
   * [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) 
   * [yarn package manager](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/)
   * [expo-cli](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/expo-cli/) `npm install -g expo-cli`
2. Clone repo

   `git clone git@github.com:seeus-dev/seeus-app.git`
3. `cd seeus-app`
4. `yarn install`
5. `expo start` to start the dev server

The dev server continually compiles the TypeScript code as it changes. It also serves the code to devices connecting to it via the Expo mobile app, enabling hot swapping of modules as the code changes.

**To run the app on your device:** Download the Expo mobile app ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en_US), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-client/id982107779)) and scan the QR code outputted in the console. In iOS you have to scan the QR code from the camera app.
